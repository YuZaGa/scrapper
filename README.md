# SMIT Result Scraper

This program scraps results of all students from the SMIT's result site for the given semester and saves it in a JSON format.

Note : This scraps results of all students irrespective of the current academic year and courses opted by them.

### Input example

(For NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2017 SEMESTER EXAMINATION)
Paste SMIT exam link : https://results.smu.edu.in/smit/results_grade_selection.php?exam=33

This scraps result of all students for all subjects and dumps it in a file called 33.json which has also been added here. '33'is the exam number present in the URL.

### test.py

This program finds result for your registration number and displays it.

This program can further be extended to calculate GPA of the students directly (soon to be on https://gpacalculator.rishavanand.com).
